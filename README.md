# Coherence_analysis
This repository hosts the second part of a biomedical research project focused on sleep disorders associated with GRIN2B mutations. This section specifically delves into imaginary coherence analysis, an advanced method used to study correlations in EEG brain signals across various frequency bands.

Imaginary coherence analysis provides crucial insights into neural connectivity, functional networks, and their alterations in various disorders, including sleep and neurodevelopmental conditions. This technique offers an effective way to understand how brain regions interact during different cognitive tasks and brain states, which is essential to deciphering the complex pathophysiology of these conditions.

In traditional coherence analysis, volume conduction can lead to spurious correlations or inaccurate connectivity measurements. Imaginary coherence analysis is less susceptible to the effects of volume conduction, thus offering a more accurate assessment of functional connectivity between brain regions.

The utility of imaginary coherence has been established in studying a variety of sleep disorders, including insomnia, sleep apnea, and narcolepsy, as it can differentiate between these conditions by revealing distinct connectivity patterns or alterations specific to each disorder. The application of imaginary coherence to GRIN2B-related sleep disorders is a burgeoning field of study. Preliminary findings suggest it holds promise as a valuable diagnostic tool in this context, warranting further investigation.

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the methods and preliminary findings of our study, with the aim of advancing understanding and research into GRIN2B-related neurodevelopmental disorders and their associated sleep disturbances.
